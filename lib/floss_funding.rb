Options:
  1. üåê  Donate or sponsor at the funding URLs above, and affirm on your honor your donor or sponsor status.
     a. Receive ethically-sourced, buy-once, activation key for each namespace.
     b. Suggested donation amounts are listed above.

  2. ü™Ñ  If open source, or not-for-profit, continue to use for free, with activation key: "#{FlossFunding::FREE_AS_IN_BEER}".

  3. üè¶  If commercial, continue to use for free, & feel a bit naughty, with activation key: "#{FlossFunding::BUSINESS_IS_NOT_GOOD_YET}".

  4. ‚úñÔ∏è  Disable activation key checks using the per-namespace opt-out keys listed above.

Then, before loading the gems, set the ENV variables listed above to your chosen key.
